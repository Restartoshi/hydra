As a minor extension, we also keep a semantic version for the `UNRELEASED`
changes.

## [1.1.0] - UNRELEASED

- Moved dependencies to `plutus-extras` instead of `hydra-test-utils`.

- Added `on-chain-cost` benchmark executable.

- Made compatible to latest `plutus-tx` and `cardano-api` changes (via
  `hydra-cardano-api` and `hydra-test-utils`).

## [1.0.0] - 2022-02-11

### Added

- Provides an initial implementation of Merkle trees which works in script validator on-chain. In particular, this allows on-chain scripts to verify merkle tree proofs built off-chain on large trees. 

- Membership verification is in log(n) where `n` is the size (i.e. number of leaves) of the tree.

- The current implementation currently always assumes SHA-256 as a hash algorithm.

- While highly inefficient, the current implementation also allows for _constructing_ merkle trees on-chain. Due to current execution limits, this is only possible for small (< 20) trees.
