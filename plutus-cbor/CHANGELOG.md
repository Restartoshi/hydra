## [1.0.1] - UNRELEASED

- Moved dependencies to `plutus-extras` instead of `hydra-test-utils`.

- Made compatible to latest `plutus-tx` and `cardano-api` changes (via
  `hydra-cardano-api` and `hydra-test-utils`).

## [1.0.0] - 2022-02-11

### Added

- Initial release defining an opaque `Encoding` type as a "naive" bytestring builder that works on-chain. The builder however requires an execution cost linear in the size of the encoded data (both memory and CPU).

- Provides support for _most_ CBOR major types; all except floating number since there's no floating number in Plutus and, it is probably a bad idea anyway to offer serialization support for floating numbers in financial contracts.
